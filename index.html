                        Biomedical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering to biology and medicine. This is evident throughout healthcare, from diagnosis and analysis to treatment and recovery, and has entered the public conscience though the proliferation of implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers and artificial hips, to more futuristic technologies such as stem cell engineering and the 3-D printing of biological organs.

                <p>Medical/biomedical imaging is a major segment of medical devices. This area deals with enabling clinicians to directly or indirectly "view" things not visible in plain sight (such as due to their size, and/or location). This can involve utilizing ultrasound, magnetism, UV, radiology, and other means. Imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis, and are typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including: fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET), PET-CT scans, projection radiography such as X-rays and CT scans, tomography, ultrasound, optical microscopy, and electron microscopy.</span></p>

                <p>Clinical engineering is the branch of biomedical engineering dealing with the actual implementation of medical equipment and technologies in hospitals or other clinical settings. Major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs), selecting technological products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T., etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state of the art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly..<span id="dots2">..</span><span id="more2" class="more"> Cluster Computing is the process of sharing the computation tasks among multiple computers or machines in the cluster through the connection between them.</span></p>

The study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering.

                <p>Genetic engineering, recombinant DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) and gene splicing are terms that apply to the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.</span></p>

                    One of the goals of tissue engineering is to create artificial organs (via biological material) for patients that need organ transplants. Biomedical engineers are currently researching methods of creating such organs. Researchers have grown solid jawbones and tracheas from human stem cells towards this end. Several artificial urinary bladders have been grown in laboratories and transplanted successfully into human patients. Bioartificial organs, which use both synthetic and biological component, are also a focus area in research, such as with hepatic assist devices that use liver cells within an artificial bioreactor construct.</span></p>

That is, biomedicine is the focal point for all other sciences. From here will form many branches such as biophysics (BioPhysics), biochemistry (BioChemistry), ... with the goal of applying concepts and laws of physics and chemistry to study life, find out the nature of chemistry. study of life processes.

Biomedical engineering is a science that takes technology as the means, biology as the mechanism, and medicine as the end. That is, using technical equipment as a means of generating agents that interact with living organisms in the body. From there, there are biological effects that can be quantified as well as qualitative. Through this study, we humans can evaluate as well as change the states, functions and structures in the body, that is, diagnose and treat diseases.

                                Tissue and stem cell engineers are working towards artificial recreation of human organs, aiding in transplants and helping millions around the world live better lives. Experts in medical devices develop new implantable and external devices such as pacemakers, coronary stents, orthopaedic implants, prosthetics, dental products, and ambulatory devices. Clinical engineers work to ensure that medical equipment is safe and reliable for use in clinical settings. Biomedical engineering is an extremely broad field with many opportunities for specialization.

                                In diagnostics, the outstanding achievement is that high-tech diagnostic devices are constantly being born, innovated and perfected. As a result, the quality of disease diagnosis is increasingly improved, and serious diseases are increasingly detected early for timely treatment. These can be described as X-ray, CT - computed tomography, DSA - digital X-ray of blood vessels by exclusion method, MRI - magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear applications (PET, SPECT). ), …

One of the important achievements in treatment is the application of laser, with many medical and surgical treatment methods achieving higher efficiency than the classic treatment. Examples include acupuncture, laser therapy, intravascular laser, percutaneous laser disc herniation, Excimer laser ("cold cutter"-non-thermal) laser treatment of refractive errors.

    Today, startups in the biomedical field in Vietnam are booming. However, the products that have been commercialized recently mostly fall into the direction of biomedical informatics (medical informatics – internet healthcare). </span>

                                In the last few years, both Forbes and CNN Money have dubbed biomedical engineering as the best health care career out there. And the possibilities within biomedical engineering are nearly endless. New innovations in technology, materials, and knowledge mean that tomorrow's breakthroughs can barely be conceived of today. After all, a generation ago, biomedical engineering, as a field, did not exist. 
                                Career paths in biomedical engineering tend to be driven by the interests of the individual: the huge breadth of the field allows biomedical engineers to develop specialties in an area that interests them, be it biomaterials, neuromodulation devices, orthopaedic repair, or even stem cell engineering. Biomedical engineers often combine an aptitude for problem solving and technical know-how with focused study in medicine, healthcare, and helping others. It is this hybridization that has led to so much innovation—and so much opportunity—in biomedical engineering.

                                Economically speaking, medical diagnostics triple in market value each year. Revolutionary advances in medical imaging and medical diagnostics are changing the way medicine is practiced. New medical devices, arising in the research laboratories of biomedical engineers around the world, have completely altered the manner by which disease and trauma is dealt with by physicians, extending the quality and length of human life.
                                Ultimately, the future of biomedical engineering is tied to both the issues and obstacles we discover and advances and achievements in fields like chemistry, materials science, and biology. Just as in most other fields, interdisciplinarity means that innovation originates from many directions at the same time.
