                    <div>Biomedical engineers play a central role in this process. They are people with many coordination skills, using their knowledge base in both engineering and medicine such as: (1) designing tools, machines, electrical circuits, software used in health diagnosis; (2) manufacture artificial organs (hip joints, kneesâ€¦) or develop new materials to replace damaged, damaged or defective biological parts; (3) installation, adjustment, maintenance, repair and improvement of biomedical equipment; (4) evaluate the safety and performance of biomedical equipment; (5) training clinicians and technicians in the correct use of equipment; (6) work with scientists and specialists to study technical aspects of human and animal biology.
